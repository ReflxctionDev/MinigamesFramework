# GradleModules
A project template with modules for Gradle

# Building
The project comes with a task named `Build JAR`. Running this task should produce the final JAR.

Do note that there will be 2 produced JARs, one with a version tag and one without. The one with no version tag is not usable and should be dismissed.
